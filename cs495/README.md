# Customizing `bibtex` style
Daniel Bochen Tan

## Motivation
URLs may change, but DOIs are constant links to papers, which is handy.
DOI is not showing up with the current bibtex style.
We want to modify the style so that DOI is appended to each bibliography item if there is a DOI in the .bib entry.

## Reverse Polish Notation
1 2 3 +

## Internal Operators
- "", doi
- empty$:
- {} {} if$
